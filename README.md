# negometer
*inactive*

An old Django project I did aimed at analyzing and tracking the relative negativity of major news networks: Fox, ABC, MSNBC, etc.

Wasn't the best or most sophisticated thing out there but I had it fully deployed on DigitalOcean and actually kind of working. It worked well enough to get me my last job. I still own negometer.com but I am not pursuing this project anymore given that the basic premise seems redundant to me now given the state of the world and news...

Deployment Checklist
1- update secret
2- append admin url
